Two weeks after her ?America First? fashion statement at the inauguration, Melania Trump emerged last weekend from the relative seclusion of her life in New York to join her husband at     a. k. a. the winter White   golf club in Florida. And as far as her sartorial language went, America was  ?   well, pretty much last. On Friday, greeting the president as he disembarked from Air Force One in Palm Beach, the first lady wore a short red Givenchy cape dress. On Saturday, at a Red Cross ball, she wore a long   gown from Christian Dior (both brands connected, by the way, to LVMH Mo?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, the only foreign luxury mogul to have made a postelection pilgrimage to Trump Tower). But on Sunday, for a Super Bowl party at Trump International Golf Club, she wore leather pants from the Row, the brand of   Olsen and Ashley Olsen, and a thin knit sweater by Derek Lam, both names at New York Fashion Week. Does it matter? On one hand, Mrs. Trump has been explicit about her desire to eschew, at least for the moment, the Washington spotlight. Perhaps her clothes are a part of that, and thus the point was simply to look elegant and not to bother with more complicated billboarding. If so, she achieved that aim. However, Mrs. Trump has also said that she intends to meaningfully inhabit the role of first lady, and certainly this appearance was part of that goal. The choice of the red dress  ?   which made for a compelling visual next to President Trump?s red tie as the two walked together along the tarmac  ?   was consciously symbolic, according to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Mrs. Trump?s senior adviser, who said it was in honor of ?National Wear Red Day, which is to highlight the importance and raise awareness about heart disease. ? So it?s not like they haven?t been thinking this through. Or that they aren?t aware of the symbolic value of dress, especially when it comes to a first lady who prefers to let her clothes do the talking. If so, there is a contradiction implicit in her choices of clothing, given her husband?s promise in his Inaugural Address that ?Buy American? would be a tenet of his administration. But the    dress requirement for first ladies, historically held dear, was largely taken off the table during the Obama administration and transformed into a vehicle for   outreach. It was Mr. Trump who made it an issue again, and in a forum arguably more public, and permanent, than Twitter. When asked about the issue, Ms. Winston Wolkoff emailed the following statement: ?Mrs. Trump is a proud and longtime supporter of American fashion. She appreciates fashion as art. As a former model, she has always been a patron of the world?s most distinguished designers both here and abroad. Mrs. Trump buys from an international mix of brands because that is what reflects her uniquely American life experience and style. She is more excited than ever to make a platform for American designers as she did on one of the most important weeks in history, the Inauguration, showcasing the extraordinary talents of American designers. ? In other words: Buying European is a reflection of the American shopping experience. For anyone who has walked down any main shopping street in a big American city  ?   such as Fifth Avenue in New York, where Mrs. Trump lives  ?   it?s hard to argue with that. Though it also seems like something of a contorted rationale, and one that could be exploited by companies seeking to relocate some factories overseas. That choice is, after all, also a part of the American industrial story. In any case, it?s worth noting that Givenchy and Dior have been playing possum since the weekend, another indication of fashion?s   relationship with Mrs. Trump. Neither fashion house issued the de rigueur news release trumpeting the first lady?s appearance in one of their dresses. Asked whether the brand had worked with the first lady on the red dress, a spokesman for Givenchy said that the company had no comment and that the dress had been purchased from a store, without any interpersonal discussion. (It is for sale on the Neiman Marcus website, among others, for $2, 095.) Dior simply did not respond. As for Mr. Lam, who in November told the fashion magazine WWD, ?I really don?t see myself getting involved with the Trump presidency,? the situation pretty much shows the problem with that stance. After all, the first lady is free to buy his product, whether he wants to get involved or not. Which is another American story, of sorts.\",\n          \"Good morning.  Here?s what you need to know: ? President Trump is expected to order the construction of a Mexican border wall today and slash immigration of refugees from ?terror prone? nations, White House officials said. He pressed automakers to increase jobs in the U.

Mr. Trump also revived two pipelines blocked under President Obama: the Keystone XL pipeline, the focus of years of debate over energy needs and climate change and the Dakota Access pipeline, the target of Native American protests. _____ ? And tensions are rising between the U. S. and China. Beijing, after a challenge from a Trump spokesman, insisted it had ?irrefutable? sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea.

Two chief questions will define what comes next: Will Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn decide to go to trial? And if he does, what sort of defense will he mount to counter what appears to be a Matterhorn of evidence against him? When Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, outlined the government?s case against Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn at a news conference on Friday, he seemed unable to disguise a sly smile of satisfaction. After all, that morning, Mr. Capers?s office had filed a memorandum that set forth in exhaustive detail the cinematic story of Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s rise from a teenage marijuana farmer to an international kingpin who armed himself with a diamond encrusted pistol. It further noted that dozens of witnesses were lined up to testify and corroborate what prosecutors described as extensive secret recordings in which Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn discussed drug transactions. Several lawyers who have represented drug lords in the past said that the aggressive tenor of the memo suggested that, at least for now, federal prosecutors were serious about trying Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn and were unlikely to offer him a deal to plead guilty to lesser charges. Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn, moreover, is facing life in prison on a sweeping count of running a continuing criminal enterprise. So there was no real downside, the lawyers said, for him to fight the government?s case. ?The government has made it clear that they?re going full bore with this,? said David O. Markus, who negotiated the 2006 guilty pleas for Gilberto and Miguel Rodr\\u00adguez Orejuela, Colombian brothers who helped found the Cali cartel. ?For El Chapo, if there?s no offer on the table and it?s life if you go to trial and life or near it if you plead guilty, it?s pretty easy  ?   he?ll go to trial. ? Before Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn has to make that decision, however, a number of complicated issues are certain to arise. Given that he has been indicted not only in Brooklyn, but also in six other federal districts, his legal team is likely to question whether he is being prosecuted in the appropriate jurisdiction. They could also attack the manner in which he was sent to New York, some lawyers said, casting doubt on whether he was properly extradited. Then there is the question of his hiring a private lawyer. For the moment, Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn is being represented by two seasoned public defenders, Michael Schneider and Michelle Gelernt. While there is a   narco bar of lawyers, mainly in Florida and Texas, who regularly handle cartel cases, many of them are already representing people who may appear as witnesses at Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s trial. Further complicating matters, the federal government has said that it wants to seize $14 billion in profits that Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn was said to have made while running the Sinaloa cartel, leaving his financial situation unclear. ?Many good criminal defense lawyers may shy away from the case not only because of the conduct that?s been charged, but because it?s hard to get paid if the government argues that all his money is   tainted,? said Benjamin Brafman, one of New York City?s top defense lawyers. But if Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn does end up before a jury, Mr. Brafman and other lawyers said that he could borrow a tactic from the manifold Mafia trials that have taken place in Brooklyn and defend himself by attacking the credibility of the government?s witnesses. According to the prosecution?s memo, ?a large coterie of cooperating witnesses?  ?   among them, Colombian cartel members, Mexican couriers and United   distributors  ?   is ready to testify about every aspect of Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s organization, including bribes paid to politicians and murders of rival drug dealers and government and law enforcement officials. ?It?s inconceivable to me that these people don?t have baggage of their own,? Mr. Brafman said, ?if, indeed, they were involved in the organization for a long time. ? The case of Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of Ismael Zambada Garc\\u00ada, who long served as Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, offers another possible avenue of defense. Mr. Zambada was arrested by the Mexican authorities in 2009 and extradited to Chicago, where he was poised to stand trial as the cartel?s chief logistics officer for importing drugs into that city. But a few years into the case his lawyers suddenly claimed that he could not be prosecuted in the United States because he had been secretly working as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Though the government subsequently acknowledged that D. E. A. agents had in fact met with Mr. Zambada, it denied that it had engaged with him in any quid pro quo. Nonetheless, in 2014, the D. E. A. announced that Mr. Zambada would not stand trial because he had pleaded guilty to trafficking charges and was working as a government informant. The possibility that Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn might also become an informant is a complicated one. Some lawyers said that because he was accused in court papers of kidnapping, torture and causing the deaths of thousands of people, it would be hard to imagine the government allowing him to cooperate  ?   unless, perhaps, he had reliable and damning information on   Mexican officials. Others said they found that prospect dubious because of Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s reputation as a Robin   hero in his homeland. ?He has this mythic legacy behind him,? said W. Rob Heroy, a lawyer for Carlos Ramon   a Mexican who pleaded guilty in 2014 to producing and distributing heroin in the United States, much of it in and around Charlotte, N. C. ?Maybe the government would want him as an informant, but I just can?t see El Chapo getting done with all of that and then going to work at a Cinnabon in Omaha. ?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Two weeks after her ?America First? fashion statement at the inauguration, Melania Trump emerged last weekend from the relative seclusion of her life in New York to join her husband at     a. k. a. the winter White   golf club in Florida. And as far as her sartorial language went, America was  ?   well, pretty much last. On Friday, greeting the president as he disembarked from Air Force One in Palm Beach, the first lady wore a short red Givenchy cape dress. On Saturday, at a Red Cross ball, she wore a long   gown from Christian Dior (both brands connected, by the way, to LVMH Mo?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, the only foreign luxury mogul to have made a postelection pilgrimage to Trump Tower). But on Sunday, for a Super Bowl party at Trump International Golf Club, she wore leather pants from the Row, the brand of   Olsen and Ashley Olsen, and a thin knit sweater by Derek Lam, both names at New York Fashion Week. Does it matter? On one hand, Mrs. Trump has been explicit about her desire to eschew, at least for the moment, the Washington spotlight. Perhaps her clothes are a part of that, and thus the point was simply to look elegant and not to bother with more complicated billboarding. If so, she achieved that aim. However, Mrs. Trump has also said that she intends to meaningfully inhabit the role of first lady, and certainly this appearance was part of that goal. The choice of the red dress  ?   which made for a compelling visual next to President Trump?s red tie as the two walked together along the tarmac  ?   was consciously symbolic, according to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Mrs. Trump?s senior adviser, who said it was in honor of ?National Wear Red Day, which is to highlight the importance and raise awareness about heart disease. ? So it?s not like they haven?t been thinking this through. Or that they aren?t aware of the symbolic value of dress, especially when it comes to a first lady who prefers to let her clothes do the talking. If so, there is a contradiction implicit in her choices of clothing, given her husband?s promise in his Inaugural Address that ?Buy American? would be a tenet of his administration. But the    dress requirement for first ladies, historically held dear, was largely taken off the table during the Obama administration and transformed into a vehicle for   outreach. It was Mr. Trump who made it an issue again, and in a forum arguably more public, and permanent, than Twitter. When asked about the issue, Ms. Winston Wolkoff emailed the following statement: ?Mrs. Trump is a proud and longtime supporter of American fashion. She appreciates fashion as art. As a former model, she has always been a patron of the world?s most distinguished designers both here and abroad. Mrs. Trump buys from an international mix of brands because that is what reflects her uniquely American life experience and style. She is more excited than ever to make a platform for American designers as she did on one of the most important weeks in history, the Inauguration, showcasing the extraordinary talents of American designers. ? In other words: Buying European is a reflection of the American shopping experience. For anyone who has walked down any main shopping street in a big American city  ?   such as Fifth Avenue in New York, where Mrs. Trump lives  ?   it?s hard to argue with that. Though it also seems like something of a contorted rationale, and one that could be exploited by companies seeking to relocate some factories overseas. That choice is, after all, also a part of the American industrial story. In any case, it?s worth noting that Givenchy and Dior have been playing possum since the weekend, another indication of fashion?s   relationship with Mrs. Trump. Neither fashion house issued the de rigueur news release trumpeting the first lady?s appearance in one of their dresses. Asked whether the brand had worked with the first lady on the red dress, a spokesman for Givenchy said that the company had no comment and that the dress had been purchased from a store, without any interpersonal discussion. (It is for sale on the Neiman Marcus website, among others, for $2, 095.) Dior simply did not respond. As for Mr. Lam, who in November told the fashion magazine WWD, ?I really don?t see myself getting involved with the Trump presidency,? the situation pretty much shows the problem with that stance. After all, the first lady is free to buy his product, whether he wants to get involved or not. Which is another American story, of sorts.\",\n          \"Good morning.  Here?s what you need to know: ? President Trump is expected to order the construction of a Mexican border wall today and slash immigration of refugees from ?terror prone? nations, White House officials said. He pressed automakers to increase jobs in the U.

Mr. Trump also revived two pipelines blocked under President Obama: the Keystone XL pipeline, the focus of years of debate over energy needs and climate change and the Dakota Access pipeline, the target of Native American protests. _____ ? And tensions are rising between the U. S. and China. Beijing, after a challenge from a Trump spokesman, insisted it had ?irrefutable? sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea.

Israel, discarding diplomatic restraint just a few days into the Trump administration, approved the construction of 2, 500 housing units for Jews in West Bank settlements. A month ago, the Obama administration declined to veto a Security Council resolution condemning the settlements, and last week, a gathering of world leaders warned Israel to stop expanding them. _____ ?

Two chief questions will define what comes next: Will Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn decide to go to trial? And if he does, what sort of defense will he mount to counter what appears to be a Matterhorn of evidence against him? When Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, outlined the government?s case against Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn at a news conference on Friday, he seemed unable to disguise a sly smile of satisfaction. After all, that morning, Mr. Capers?s office had filed a memorandum that set forth in exhaustive detail the cinematic story of Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s rise from a teenage marijuana farmer to an international kingpin who armed himself with a diamond encrusted pistol. It further noted that dozens of witnesses were lined up to testify and corroborate what prosecutors described as extensive secret recordings in which Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn discussed drug transactions. Several lawyers who have represented drug lords in the past said that the aggressive tenor of the memo suggested that, at least for now, federal prosecutors were serious about trying Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn and were unlikely to offer him a deal to plead guilty to lesser charges. Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn, moreover, is facing life in prison on a sweeping count of running a continuing criminal enterprise. So there was no real downside, the lawyers said, for him to fight the government?s case. ?The government has made it clear that they?re going full bore with this,? said David O. Markus, who negotiated the 2006 guilty pleas for Gilberto and Miguel Rodr\\u00adguez Orejuela, Colombian brothers who helped found the Cali cartel. ?For El Chapo, if there?s no offer on the table and it?s life if you go to trial and life or near it if you plead guilty, it?s pretty easy  ?   he?ll go to trial. ? Before Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn has to make that decision, however, a number of complicated issues are certain to arise. Given that he has been indicted not only in Brooklyn, but also in six other federal districts, his legal team is likely to question whether he is being prosecuted in the appropriate jurisdiction. They could also attack the manner in which he was sent to New York, some lawyers said, casting doubt on whether he was properly extradited. Then there is the question of his hiring a private lawyer. For the moment, Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn is being represented by two seasoned public defenders, Michael Schneider and Michelle Gelernt. While there is a   narco bar of lawyers, mainly in Florida and Texas, who regularly handle cartel cases, many of them are already representing people who may appear as witnesses at Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s trial. Further complicating matters, the federal government has said that it wants to seize $14 billion in profits that Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn was said to have made while running the Sinaloa cartel, leaving his financial situation unclear. ?Many good criminal defense lawyers may shy away from the case not only because of the conduct that?s been charged, but because it?s hard to get paid if the government argues that all his money is   tainted,? said Benjamin Brafman, one of New York City?s top defense lawyers. But if Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn does end up before a jury, Mr. Brafman and other lawyers said that he could borrow a tactic from the manifold Mafia trials that have taken place in Brooklyn and defend himself by attacking the credibility of the government?s witnesses. According to the prosecution?s memo, ?a large coterie of cooperating witnesses?  ?   among them, Colombian cartel members, Mexican couriers and United   distributors  ?   is ready to testify about every aspect of Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s organization, including bribes paid to politicians and murders of rival drug dealers and government and law enforcement officials. ?It?s inconceivable to me that these people don?t have baggage of their own,? Mr. Brafman said, ?if, indeed, they were involved in the organization for a long time. ? The case of Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of Ismael Zambada Garc\\u00ada, who long served as Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, offers another possible avenue of defense. Mr. Zambada was arrested by the Mexican authorities in 2009 and extradited to Chicago, where he was poised to stand trial as the cartel?s chief logistics officer for importing drugs into that city. But a few years into the case his lawyers suddenly claimed that he could not be prosecuted in the United States because he had been secretly working as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Though the government subsequently acknowledged that D. E. A. agents had in fact met with Mr. Zambada, it denied that it had engaged with him in any quid pro quo. Nonetheless, in 2014, the D. E. A. announced that Mr. Zambada would not stand trial because he had pleaded guilty to trafficking charges and was working as a government informant. The possibility that Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn might also become an informant is a complicated one. Some lawyers said that because he was accused in court papers of kidnapping, torture and causing the deaths of thousands of people, it would be hard to imagine the government allowing him to cooperate  ?   unless, perhaps, he had reliable and damning information on   Mexican officials. Others said they found that prospect dubious because of Mr. Guzm\\u00ffn?s reputation as a Robin   hero in his homeland. ?He has this mythic legacy behind him,? said W. Rob Heroy, a lawyer for Carlos Ramon   a Mexican who pleaded guilty in 2014 to producing and distributing heroin in the United States, much of it in and around Charlotte, N. C. ?Maybe the government would want him as an informant, but I just can?t see El Chapo getting done with all of that and then going to work at a Cinnabon in Omaha. ?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "After learning she had a high genetic risk for breast cancer , Dane ? e McCree , like a growing number of women , decided to have her breasts removed . Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with breasts . It did . But while Ms. McCree ? s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts , it is now completely numb . Her nipples lack any feeling . She can not sense the slightest touch of her breasts , perceive warmth or cold , feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door . And no one warned her . ? I can ? t even feel it when my kids hug me , ? said Ms. McCree , 31 , a store manager in Grand Junction , Colo. who is raising two daughters on her own . Plastic surgeons performed more than 106 , 000 breast reconstructions in 2015 , up 35 percent from 2000 . And they have embraced techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural ? look and feel ? ? using a woman ? s belly fat to create the new breast , sparing the nipple , minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger , firmer lifted breasts . Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before . But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms . Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear . The main problem is using the word ? feel , ? said Dr. Clara Lee , an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery . Surgeons who use a woman ? s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will ? feel ? like a natural breast , referring to how it feels to someone else , not the woman . ? We don ? t always mean what ? s important to the patient , ? Dr. Lee said . ? Our focus has been on what women look like , ? said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic , a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients ? quality of life after breast surgery . ? What it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery . That ? s the next frontier . ? The focus on how breasts look and feel to other people , rather than how they feel to the patient , speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance , said Victoria a professor and the head of feminist , gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University . ? There ? s such a strong cultural gaze at women ? s breasts , ? Dr. said . ? It does raise the question : Who is breast reconstruction for ? ? Adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations , particularly ? ? mastectomies . During a traditional mastectomy , doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue , causing considerable nerve damage . But now , in certain cases , the nipple can be spared , raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved . The actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her preventive double mastectomy in a New York Times in 2013 , inspiring other women at high risk of breast cancer to have their breasts removed . But the surgery has yet to fulfill its promise , and in most cases , sensation is not restored . For many women , the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating . ? No one said , ? You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again , ? ? Ms. McCree said . ? I thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply , I ? d keep my feeling . ? Eve Wallinga , 60 , a cancer survivor from St . Cloud , Minn. said many women who choose mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them ? whole ? again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back . ? They go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out ? they ? ll just have stuffing in their breasts , ? Ms. Wallinga said . ? Some are very angry and upset , and say , ? Why wasn ? t I told ? ? They feel very betrayed . ? The lack of sensation is potentially dangerous . Women who have had mastectomies and reconstruction surgery have sustained severe burns on their breasts from heating pads , hair dryers , curling irons , sunbathing and overly hot showers . Several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood . Many described embarrassing ? wardrobe malfunctions , ? when a bathing suit or shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin . A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later . Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts . ? It ? s not just about the sexual arousal , it ? s the awkwardness , ? said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights , N. J . ? You can ? t figure out your space ? almost like you ? re bigger than you really are . It ? s a bizarre feeling . ? She added , ? When I put on a sports bra , I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they ? re in the pocket where they belong . ? Nerve damage during mastectomies can create pain syndrome . Some women experience tingling sensations , and others have debilitating pain . Patients say physicians minimize the condition , even though it is fairly common , affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients , according to published studies . Michelle Lamon Romero , 45 , of East Longmeadow , Mass . said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago . She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level . ? The surface of the skin is numb ? if you run a needle over it , I can ? t feel it , ? Ms. Romero said . ? But I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere . ? She added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that ? this isn ? t real , it ? s all in your head . ? Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience . ? So many women who join are just relieved to know they ? re not alone , ? Ms. Romero said . ? They all start out the same way : ? My doctor told me I was crazy . ? ? Most surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman ? s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue . The procedure has produced modest results . If sensation returns , it is usually limited to the perception of pressure , without improved sensation related to touch , temperature or sexual arousal . ? It ? s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before , ? said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins , a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic . ? It ? s a poor substitute . ? Dr. Aldona J. Spiegel , a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation , said the procedure remained promising . ? I tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast , it will improve the sensation . But I never tell them it will be normal , ? Dr. Spiegel said . She added that many of her patients had shown ? very significant improvement . ? One of her patients , Karen Holt , 65 , a retired principal from Houston , had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago . Ms. Holt knows she ? s unusual , she said , but claims she has ? just about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right . ? But doctors say such results are rare . ? You don ? t want to give people false hope , ? said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce , a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans . Restoring sensation is ? one of those things that ? s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction , ? he said . ? But no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we ? re able to return sensation in any reliable way . ? Dr. Christine Laronga , a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa , Fla. said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction , telling them , ? It may look like a breast , but it won ? t feel like a breast . ? While doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves , they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone . There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome . ? It ? s a very tricky area , ? said Dr. Ida K. Fox , a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery . ? You don ? t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain . ? Ms. Balsamo , 50 , who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk , said she did not regret the surgery , but wished she had been better informed . ? I just wish I had known , ? Ms. Balsamo said . ? They said there ? s going to be a difference in the sensation ? not that there wouldn ? t be any . Before you go in , shouldn ? t you know the facts ? ?\n",
            "BEIJING ? A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012 , local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device . For more than three decades , this was national policy in China . The IUD was the government ? s most important tool for limiting couples to one child , and almost all new mothers were required to get one . Ms. Lu , a former advertising executive , considered the demand invasive , insulting and potentially harmful to her health . Still , like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her , she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in . Now , a year after abandoning the ? ? policy , the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her ? by removing their IUDs , free of charge . But the offer , made without even a hint of an apology , has provoked incredulous outrage . ? We shouldn ? t even have had this in the first place , and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people , ? Ms. Lu , 36 , scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of Linyi . ? It ? s like they are slapping themselves in the face . ? While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor ? s office , surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract , some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all . But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government ? s getting involved , yet again , in their private lives . And for many mothers , the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child . ? It ? s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound , ? said Zhang Xintian , 25 , who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades . In China , women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until menopause while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years , those used in China offer birth control for much longer . China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child , and sterilized after they had two , in the early 1980s . Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance . Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs . From 1980 to 2014 , according to official statistics , 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs . And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or , as is commonly said , got their ? tubes tied . ? Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets , leading some to order that the procedures ? as well as abortions ? be performed by force on women who resisted . Then last year , confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force , President Xi Jinping relegated the policy to the Communist Party ? s scrap heap of discarded dogma . And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake , the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with reproducing . To that end , an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child . ? Our country provides support in terms of law , finance and service systems to ensure citizens ? access to the free removal of IUDs , ? said the official , Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission ? s department of women and children . But the reversal , the paternalistic attitude , the failure to accept any culpability ? for some , it was too much . Within hours of the news conference , the internet was fuming with indignation . The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to ? involuntary , forced acts of mutilation , ? Han Haoyue , a popular columnist , wrote in a post shared nearly 3 , 000 times on Weibo , China ? s version of Twitter . ? And now , to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women ? repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit ? they have no shame , second to none . ? Over the years , many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD , which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization . In the novel ? Frog , ? by Mo Yan , the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize in Literature , the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them . In mainland China , being fitted with an IUD is called ? shang huan , ? a phrase that literally means ? installing a loop , ? referring to the stainless steel ring that was the state ? s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of complications . The rings were replaced in the by safer and more effective IUDs . According to gynecologists in China , IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely , with surgery necessary to take them out . Dr. Gloria Korta , a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts , who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001 , said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years , it was small . Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model , there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD ? s impact on women ? s health . In 2012 , the online portal Tencent published a lengthy report arguing that many Chinese women had ? experienced serious damage to their mental and physical health ? from the IUD campaign because of ? rough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions . ? Ai Xiaoming , 63 , a prominent documentary filmmaker , said many women , herself included , had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD . She had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her IUD was botched . ? In the eyes of the government , women are labor units , ? Ms. Ai said . ? When the country needs you to give birth , you have to do so . And when they don ? t need you to give birth , you don ? t . ? Even before the end of the policy , the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications . Others , including Ms. Zhang ? s mother , did it without permission , paying sympathetic doctors to remove them . But Wang Feng , a sociology professor at the University of California , Irvine , who studies the policy , said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale . ? They were anticipating the numbers , how many operations need to be done , as if this is another government program , ? he said . The government ? s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation ? s plummeting birthrate , now one of the lowest in the world . According to 2015 data , Chinese women had 1 . 05 children on average , well below the population replacement rate of more than 2 . 1 . With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China , scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis . But many couples are not interested in having a second child , some because of the potential costs , others because of their age . Cao Cuihua , 35 , a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a boy , said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children . ? I did think about having a second child , but my economic circumstances don ? t allow it , ? she said . ? This national policy to have two children has come a bit too late . ? Yi Fuxian , a scientist at the University of who studies China ? s demographics , said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older . ? Most people have already lost the ability to give birth , ? Dr. Yi said by email . ? The willingness to have children is already very low , so the Chinese government ? s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail . It will have little effect on the birthrate . ? Mao Qun ? an , a spokesman for China ? s family planning commission , defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies . ( Such procedures are more complicated , and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them . ) Dr. Dalice Marriott , a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital , said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of ? having it embedded in the uterine wall . ? ? That makes it much more difficult to remove , ? Dr. Marriott said , adding that the surgery could result in bleeding , infection and injury to the uterus . Asked about the public outcry over the government ? s offer to remove IUDs , Mr. Mao replied , ? We did not deliberately emphasize that it ? s a government benefit . ? Li Yinhe , a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family , defended the government ? s approach , arguing that population control measures were ? not targeted against women ? s rights . ? ? If the state doesn ? t engage in this , then it ? s not only a disadvantage for men , it also hurts the interests of women , ? she said . ? Women giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society . ? But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong . ? What they ? ve done to women is inhumane , ? said Xu Dali , 35 , a mother of two sons in Linyi . ? Why did the government force every women then to have an IUD ? At that time , why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman ? ?\n",
            "Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if , along with the usual radiation , they also take drugs to block male hormones . The finding , published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine , comes from a study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients . After surgery to remove the prostate , more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence , and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them . Most are given radiation , but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent . The study , paid for by the National Cancer Institute , showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment , 76 . 3 percent were still alive after 12 years , compared to 71 . 3 percent who had radiation alone . At 12 years , the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer ? 5 . 8 percent versus 13 . 4 percent ? or to have the cancer spread around their bodies ? 14 . 5 percent versus 23 percent . ? This is a big deal , ? said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr. of the Christus Santa Rosa Health System in San Antonio , who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it . ? There are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we don ? t know if they make a big difference in survival . This is one of the things where now we can say for sure . ? He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice . The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration , and the treatments can cause hot flashes , sexual problems and other side effects . So to put a man through it , said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman , an author of the study , ? you ? d better have some decent justification . ? Dr. David F. Penson , the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said the study ? gives more credence to the concept that you have to treat the whole patient , ? rather than just irradiating the area where the cancer used to be . He said the idea of blocking hormones in men like those in the study was finding its way into medical practice . About 161 , 360 new cases of prostate cancer and 26 , 730 deaths are expected in the United States in 2017 , according to the American Cancer Society . The average age at diagnosis is 66 . Globally , there were 1 . 1 million cases and 307 , 000 deaths in 2012 , the most recent data available from the World Health Organization . The study , begun in 1998 and led by Dr. William U. Shipley , a radiation oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital , had an ambitious goal : to follow the patients long enough to find out whether treatment would affect their survival . Prostate cancer grows slowly , so it took well over a decade for answers to emerge . Researchers and patients from 150 sites in North America participated . The patients were 760 men who had their prostates removed for cancer that had not spread , but who then had a sign of recurrence ? a rise in their blood levels of antigen , or PSA , a protein associated with prostate cancer . The men in the study had PSAs of 0 . 2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter . ? That ? s just like the first wisp of smoke , ? said Dr. Zietman , who is a professor of radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School . ? There ? ll be fire someday . ? The fire might take five , 10 or 15 years to break out , but Dr. Zietman said , ? Many are in their 50s or 60s , and will live long enough to get into trouble . ? The traditional practice for a rising PSA after surgery has been to give radiation , which targets only the pelvis . The idea of the study was to add hormonal treatment , which might stop minute clumps of cancer that had spread to other parts of the body . All the men in the study had radiation for six and a half weeks . For two years , half also received a drug , bicalutamide , and the other half were given placebos . They were followed , on average , for about 13 years . ? This is the first trial that ? s shown , if you follow these patients long enough , there is a real difference , ? Dr. Zietman said . ? More people survive 15 years later . ? Men who had more aggressive cancers ? reflected by higher PSA readings after surgery and by the pathology and surgical reports on their tumors ? had the most to gain from the treatment . The results do not mean that every man with a rising PSA after surgery should have hormone treatment , Dr. Zietman said . Men 75 or older may not need it , because they may die from other causes before the cancer can catch up with them . ? But if they ? re younger and with a longer life expectancy , treatment is reasonable , ? he said . Bicalutamide causes men to develop breasts and potentially other problems , and the high dose given in the study is no longer used in the United States . Other drugs like Lupron have mostly taken its place , and may be even more effective , Dr. Zietman said . The study proved the concept that hormone blocking increases survival , he added , so other drugs that do the same thing should also help patients live longer . Another study in progress in Canada and Europe uses the newer drugs , and is trying to determine whether taking them for six months , rather than two years , might be enough .\n",
            "Kiah Stokes celebrated New Year ? s Eve at a nightclub in Istanbul , where she plays basketball for Besiktas of the Turkish league . But a night of revelry turned alarming when club employees told patrons they had to shut down early for security reasons . As Stokes and her friends left the building , they saw roads . They cautiously walked for about 10 minutes before finding a taxi to take them home , not knowing that a gunman had killed 39 people at another club down the street and was still at large . ? You don ? t think something can happen , ? said Stokes , who , in September , finished her second season with the Liberty of the W. N. B . A . ? Now I ? m like , ? Wow , this is just scary . ? ? Players like Stokes have long packed up after the W. N. B . A. season and spent their winters abroad , competing with teams that offer larger paychecks than the women can earn in the American league . This more W. N. B . A. players ended up in Turkey than in any other country . There are now 26 , according to the league ? s players ? association . The unrest there ? an attempted coup last summer and multiple terrorist attacks ? has led some players to question the costs of taking a second job overseas . It has also added urgency to efforts to keep W. N. B . A. players in the United States in the . ? It ? s kind of sad we can ? t stay home , ? said Liberty guard Sugar Rodgers , who played for the Turkish club Osmaniye but returned to Virginia in November because she did not feel safe . About two weeks after the Liberty were eliminated from the playoffs , Rodgers joined Osmaniye , which is based about two hours from the Syrian border . Shortly after her arrival , a car bombing killed at least 17 people at a checkpoint in Syria ? s Aleppo Province . ? That right there shook me , ? said Rodgers , who has also played in France , Israel and Slovakia . She acknowledged that the United States was not immune to such violence , but in Turkey , the threat of danger felt almost constant . ? Getting emails saying families from embassies are leaving ? the consulate or embassy were leaving ? that rings a bell , ? Rodgers said . She soon got out of her contract . ? My team was understanding , ? Rodgers said , adding , ? I ? m not going to play to my full potential always watching over my back . ? As Turkey became increasingly unstable last year , the W. N. B . A. and the players ? association arranged new security measures for the women who would go overseas in the . In late December , the league provided an app that would allow players to communicate easily with the W. N. B . A. office from anywhere in the world . In an emergency , the office can give information about safe areas and contacts . Jayne ? the union ? s associate director of player relations , who competed in China and Turkey as well as in the W. N. B . A. ? set up and maintained a group chat for the league ? s players in Turkey . When Terri Carmichael Jackson , a former N. C. A . A. executive , became the director of operations for the players ? association last May , she focused on improving security for players overseas . The union met with the league ? s director of security , Eric Rhodes , who suggested more collaboration with the State Department and some relatively simple measures , like pointing players to the department ? s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program . The program , a State Department spokesman said , allows travelers to ? receive messages from the nearest U. S. Embassy or Consulate , which stand at the ready to assist U. S. citizens abroad . ? ? We get news of an incident , ? Jackson said , ? and we kind of have a plan in place , informally , here in the office . ? She added , ? There ? s always a concern there might be a blackout with media and news services . ? Lisa M. Borders , the W. N. B . A. ? s president , was attending church services when she heard about the Istanbul attack . Last season , her first as president , Borders gave her personal cellphone number to every player in the league . Until New Year ? s Eve , it was seen primarily as a gesture of good will . Borders said that after contacting the league ? s security officials that night for instructions , she reached out to players individually . She declined to name which players had communicated with her . ? I feel compelled to be deeply engaged with my players overseas , as well as domestically , ? she said . ? Speaking to players immediately in harm ? s way is very relieving to me ? that I can reach them with a phone call , that they will answer me or FaceTime me and let me know what ? s happening . ? Players have noticed the league ? s increased efforts to ensure their safety abroad . But many pointed out that they would not feel the need to leave the United States if their W. N. B . A. salaries were higher . According to the most recent agreement , players in the W. N. B . A. received a base salary of $ 39 , 676 to $ 50 , 617 in 2016 , not including performance bonuses , housing stipends and other benefits . A player in her third year made as much as $ 54 , 609 . The most recent agreement also included a $ 50 , 000 bonus for each team to distribute among players who limit their overseas competition to three months or less . Aside from relieving security fears , an athlete who stays in the United States avoids the physical stress of an extra basketball season . The league also offers professional internships and programs for the and it is considering other ways to keep players home in the winter . ? I get it , ? Borders said . ? You want to make sure you are having one job making enough money to pay bills , sustain family and do things we all want to do . That day will come . ? The league needs more revenue for that to happen , she said , adding that her chief operating officer , Jay Parry , met early this month with executives from each team to explore ways to increase attendance . Stokes , who did not disclose her Besiktas salary , said she would probably forgo her second job if the W. N. B . A. could replace most of her overseas income . An ESPN article in 2012 quoted an agent ? s estimate that the average overseas salary for a female basketball player was $ 72 , 000 . For now , Stokes plans to remain in Turkey until the season ends in early May , despite the hazards . A few weeks before the New Year ? s Eve attack , dozens of people were killed in a double bombing outside Besiktas ? s soccer stadium , about a mile from where Stokes lives . ? It freaked me out , ? she said . She had read about the country ? s turmoil during the summer , but she took comfort in knowing that a Liberty teammate who had played in Turkey before , Shavonte Zellous , would also be on the Besiktas team . But Zellous said her past experience in the country did not match what she was seeing this season . ? The cities they ? re bombing , I never imagined terror groups doing something in these cities , ? Zellous said . ? I think stuff is really getting real now . ? Stokes said that security measures had become noticeably stronger at games and that the team had more frequent police escorts on the road . She also said that she had become attached to her Turkish team and felt a certain level of commitment to it , even if friends and family yearn for her to return . ? My mom wants me to come home right now , ? Stokes said . ? She said it ? s too dangerous , it ? s scary . She knows the money is good , but it ? s not worth it . It definitely crossed my mind . ?\n",
            "The Season 7 ? Real Housewives of New Jersey ? reunion show took place in October in a theater in Westbury , N. Y . An elaborate thing had been constructed on a stage that would soon seat the five Housewives , complete with a rug and zebra chairs , everything sparkling , everything . The set was erected so specifically and thoroughly that it included a kitchen in the back , unusable but complete , that you could see only a fraction of , and a fireplace that the cameras would never pick up . ? That ? s not a real fireplace ? ? I asked a production assistant , who answered , ? It ? s not not real . ? The five contracted Housewives arrived on Long Island the night before for this reckoning of the season ? s tensions , equal parts State of the State panel discussion and of every lunchtime confrontation that occurred at my high school . The Housewives were shuttled in black S. U. V.s under the cover of darkness to a hotel more than two hours from where they live , in order to ? throw off the scent to the press , ? a publicist told me , though ? scent ? is a strange word choice here because anyone with a nose could have the place from the sheer concentration of applied Shalimar . But there was good reason for the secrecy . Leaks from these reunion shows have been rampant , and after a previous one , Andy Cohen , the mediator and the franchise creator ( or as he says , ? the person who gets credit for creating the franchise ? when , really , a lot of other people were involved ) realized that the leaks might be coming from the hair and makeup teams , who watch the live feed from a holding room . He told the producers to cut the audio to those dressing rooms . Since then , the integrity of his reunion show ? if , again , ? integrity ? is the right word to describe the absolute ravaging of women by their former , current and future friends , accusing one another of everything from having had more than their admitted amount of plastic surgery to being an actual F. B. I. snitch ? has been intact . The only leaks would be coming from Cohen , and they ? d come when he decided they would come . Cohen prepared himself in a sunny , makeshift dressing room on the first floor , standing shirtless as he tried to choose a tie for the ? yes , that ? s ? taping . His voice was a hoarse whisper , stubbornly projected through sheer will from deep behind his sternum . He had just come from disseminating his Andyness throughout the country on a speaking tour with his friend Anderson Cooper , in which both men told stories from their personal lives and drank Fresquilas on stage . There were a few appearances for his coming book tour for ? Superficial : More Adventures From the Andy Cohen Diaries . ? He had been talking for hours on his weekly radio shows ( plural ) as well as negotiating and announcing his new book imprint , Andy Cohen Books . He had been hosting his nightly live talk show on Bravo , ? Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen . ? And of course , he continued to the ? Real Housewives ? franchise , watching cuts of each episode for all seven cities , giving notes , hiring , firing , reconsidering and fielding text messages from the stars of those shows , sometimes replying purely with emoji . I told him that the Housewives , who were waiting for the taping to begin , seemed nervous . ? A lot of them view me as kind of their daddy in some weird , sick way , and their boss , and their friend , and their boyfriend , and their enemy ? and so there ? s a lot of different psychological layers happening in a situation like this , ? he replied . ? Some of them are volatile women . So it ? s all real . It ? s all real . ? Below the street , in their dressing rooms , the Housewives breathed through the tension . They had lived their reality on camera and watched the results . They had heard their Housewife colleagues talk about their behavior in interviews . And they had built within themselves a caldron of anger , resentment and oh , yeah ? s to what they had seen . So as not to dilute their fury , so as not to lose one moment of heat for the cameras , the publicists brought them to me separately through secured hallways , like Hannibal Lecter on his gurney . Teresa Giudice , who wore a satin evening gown and body shimmer ( it was 8 a. m. ) told me she used to be nervous about confronting certain cast members at these reunions , but now , since serving a prison term for fraud in 2015 , which she continually refers to as ? the time I went away , ? she ? s fine she ? s ready for her day in court or whatever this is for her . She used to resent Cohen , because she thought he was hardest on her , but now she takes a more nuanced view . ? I think he ? s an amazing guy , ? she said . ? If he was straight , I definitely would date him . ? Jacqueline Laurita , who was Teresa ? s best friend but has now replaced Melissa Gorga as Teresa ? s sworn enemy for life , admitted that she was expecting a blood bath . ? Yeah , it feels like you ? re walking to the electric chair ? is how she put it . She knew she would be held accountable for crimes that included calling Teresa a ? criminal ? and accusing Teresa ? s allies of being her ? soldiers . ? Jacqueline knew she just had to endure it . She has stopped trying to game Cohen at these things . ? He greets you with a smile , and he has a way about him , and he makes you feel comfortable talking about things , and he can pull the best and the worst out of you with a smile on his face . ? She agreed that the best way to think of Cohen is the way you think of Jesus . You pray to him for blessings ? to get more airtime , to get a rival off the show ? but like Jesus himself , he answers prayers only sometimes . In his sunny dressing room up above , I asked Cohen how he ? d feel if , like the Housewives , he were about to be confronted by everyone he ? d interacted with this year . ? I ? m not on a reality show about my life ? was his answer . It annoys him , this implication that what he ? s doing is somehow cruel to the women who have signed up for it . But don ? t you feel bad for them ? I wanted to know . He shook his head , the way he would every time I didn ? t get it . These women , who were once housewives , real housewives , are now businesswomen . Teresa Giudice is a New York Times author . Melissa Gorga has a successful clothing store . Jacqueline Laurita now has a platform to talk about her son ? s autism and for her husband to sell a brand called the Little Kernel . ? I ? m in a business relationship with these women , ? he said . ? They know what they ? re doing . ? He put on his shirt and picked the striped tie . Walking out , he was intercepted by Kathleen French , a senior vice president at Bravo , who said that things had become a little too crazy the night before at the end of the ? Real Housewives of Orange County ? trip to Ireland . ? Don ? t tell me any more , ? he said . ? Let me just see it . ? He took his place in the fake living room and sat down . ? Very casual , ? he said as the women out in their restrictive formal wear , a deep mustard and hair spritzed to within an inch of laws . ? This is their Super Bowl , ? he told me when I asked why they were in tie before 8 a. m. Over the next few hours , as they said things like ? Oh , really , bitch ? ? and ? I was friends with Teresa when she was chasing a prostitution whore out of a country club ? and ? Do I look like an ape ? ? and ? I ? m turning you off ? and ? You ? re a dumb bitch , ? Cohen ? s placid cool sometimes gave way to frustration . ? Stay on your couches ! ? he beseeched them . ? Don ? t push Daddy ! ? He put a finger gun to his head as Teresa accused Jacqueline of selling a story to a tabloid . He won ? t like that I began this article with the ? Housewives . ? Cohen has hosted a nightly talk show now for more than seven years that features scintillating conversation with celebrities and ( O. K. yes ) clips of Bravo shows , but his guests are legitimate stars , like Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey and ( O. K. yes ) Real Housewives . ? Watch What Happens Live ? is doing well , with nearly 800 , 000 viewers a night . The set just expanded to accommodate twice its audience . But you can ? t talk about Cohen without talking about the empire that he helped create in 2006 ? a juggernaut of unscripted television , with all but one of the locales ( it ? s Dallas ) averaging two or three million viewers per episode . ? Real Housewives ? is watched sincerely , it is watched as camp . It is it is it is it is pored over by at least one very funny podcast ( ? Bitch Sesh ? ) it is debated by feminists , it is singled out for a particular kind of cultural degradation that has seeped into our national conversation and it is fairly said to have been a factor in our recent elevation of a host to the highest office of this country , a man who apparently spent Thanksgiving asking his guests , style , whom he should pick for secretary of state . Cohen was at a Jewish Federation speaking gig in Washington recently when a man raised his hand and asked if he felt responsible for the level of discourse that the American republic had descended to in the last few months . It was two weeks before the election , and the question was fair . Over the 10 million episodes of ? Real Housewives ? I watched this fall , I heard people say to one another , ? I just wan na friggin rip his balls off ? and ? Put away your penis . .. and maybe someone would treat you like a woman . ? I saw a woman flip a table when she was angry , a woman who threw her fake leg when she was angry ( more on this later ) . I saw women demand respect , respect , respect , saying , ? You don ? t respect me ? and ? That is not respect ? and ? That ? s disrespectful , ? respect in the way that people who conduct themselves respectfully and respectably seldom feel the need to demand out loud . Over in the presidential debates , meanwhile , Hillary Clinton was called a ? nasty woman , ? and Donald Trump ? s Twitter feed seemed as if it had been ghostwritten by Kelly Dodd , the Real Housewife of Orange County responsible for such Twitter pronouncements as : ? Got my phone hacked with the fraud Dept . Going to get a private investigator and I ? m going to sue press charges ! ! Good luck Thunderdome . ? But Cohen told that man in Washington this : ? First of all , the ? Housewives ? are entertainment . Second of all , in the ? Housewives universe , ? you get punished for behaving badly . There are consequences to it . ? The consequences to Donald Trump ? s behavior , by contrast , seemed to be more people loving him . Had he seen the polls ? I asked . He had made a similar speech to me , and I was skeptical . Trump ? s not going to win , I told him . Cohen pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows and tilted his head back and forth in consideration . ? You never know . ? I didn ? t listen to him . No one did , not even when he conducted two televised and dubiously scientific polls of the people who tuned into ? Watch What Happens Live ? and turned up numbers based on about 60 , 000 votes that said , actually , yes , Trump was going to win . He ? s used to that . ? There ? s a lot of times when I will say something about politics , and people will immediately discount me , and I think it ? s the easiest way to discount my show too . It ? s just like , Oh , that ? s the ? Housewives ? guy , who cares ? ? Cohen explained a few weeks after the reunion . We were at Cafe Cluny in the West Village for lunch in the 3 p. m. hour , which is the approximate time lunch happens for someone who goes to bed at about 2 a. m. each night , often following a massage . He ordered a salad and then stared down the three pieces of dark chocolate that came with the check . ? I think I ? m about it , but on the other hand , if that ? s what I am , I ? m also good with it because it ? s a wonderful thing to be . ? His voice didn ? t get less hoarse over the months I spent with him . ? You know what I mean ? ? He opened his mouth to say something else , only to remember that control in an interview resides with the person who can stop talking . ? Look , I was a thinking person before the Housewives ever came . ? He took a piece of the chocolate . ? I ? ve been a TV producer for a long time ? not that that ? s Mensa , but I ? ve had a career , and I made my own way . So I just think , If I ever say something that someone doesn ? t want to hear , it ? s a very easy thing to then say , Oh , well , coming from the ? Housewives ? guy , oh , really , Mr. ? Real Housewives ? ? ? He is lately , at 48 , consumed with trying to gauge exactly where he stands in the national esteem . When I first met him , in his downtown office , a few minutes before he went on the air , he asked me why I wanted to do an article on him . ? I ? m just not that introspective , ? he said . I took this to mean he possessed the natural discomfort that a producer might have with someone else telling his story . But soon I realized it was more about positioning : Do we think of him as the ? Housewives ? guy ? or as a former Bravo head of development who has a thriving production company ? Or a guy with his own channel on Sirius XM Radio that features shows with Sandra Bernhard and Dan Rather ? Or the author of three books , or the host of a nightly talk show , the first one in late night with a working bar , no matter what James Corden says ? He is no longer what he started out as on the talk show , the kind of person who could ask the question we wanted answered ( like : Jacqueline , why would you sit on that woman ? s lap after she threatened to ? rage on your ass ? ? ) . Now he ? s one of the famous people . And so he is these days often trying to figure out a metric by which he can ascertain where he falls in the fame food chain . In ? Superficial , ? there ? s a diary entry in which he talks about getting a invitation from his good friend Sarah Jessica Parker to be her date for the Met Gala ? so that ? s data . But he goes to Ralph Lauren to get a tux for the event and the one he likes is being held for Bobby Cannavale , and he spends a little time trying to process that he doesn ? t have more pull than Bobby Cannavale . Another tux he likes is being held for Johnny Depp , which is O. K. with him , because of course Johnny Depp . ? It didn ? t piss me off , ? he insisted when I asked about the incident and his calculations surrounding it . ? No . I was like , oh , O. K. oh , good , here ? s a ranking , and now I know where I stand . They ? re telling me where I stand . I ? m finding out how this works . ? He paused for a second . ? I ? m just psyched that I ? m getting a tux . ? O. K. maybe it did sting a little when Vanity Fair had an article devoted to the hosts of late night , and Cohen seemed to be the only one excluded from it . Trevor Noah hadn ? t even made his debut yet ! But again , this is just data . ? Everything ? s good , ? he insisted . ? I have my health . I have my show . I have my life . You know what I mean ? ? But also , ? I think my show is a late show , you know ? ? Don ? t read any of this as defeated or bitter . If there ? s one thing about Cohen , it ? s that his respect for the democratic rhythms of popular culture and popularity in general is total . He wants to watch the rise and fall of things , even himself , without trying to manipulate the process . He wants it all to play out . The people will decide , and watching what the people decide and how they decide is far more important than the decision itself . From a young age , there was something about Andy Cohen that his mother couldn ? t quite put her finger on . They would watch ? All My Children ? together during the era ( ) which she wondered if maybe other sons weren ? t doing with their mothers . He had a Diana Ross poster on his wall . What was it , though ? What was it ? Then one day , she was watching him ? prance ? ( her word ) across the stage in his high school ? s performance of ? Carousel , ? and a notion crept in and took hold . She got home that night and looked under his bed , where she found a healthy stash of gay porn . Now she was sure something was going on , but what ? She spoke with a psychologist she knew who understood gay issues because he had a gay relative , and that psychologist told her that maybe she should stop looking under his bed . Andy was about to leave for college , for Boston University , and the psychologist said , ? B . U. is a good place for him to go for that , he ? ll meet a lot of other gay people , ? and now his mother really began to suspect something was up . A few years later , Cohen wrote a letter to a friend that he left on his parents ? kitchen table , and his mother read it and sat him down and asked him if he was sure . And he told her he was . A mother always knows . He knew he wanted to be onscreen even in high school , but he didn ? t want to play characters . He wanted to be famous for being himself , but at the time , that idea didn ? t truly exist yet outside the news and shows like Oprah and ? Donahue . ? ? I liked the idea of being myself in front of the camera . So , just me being me . I used to think if I could work on a morning show then I could be me . ? He got a job as an intern at CBS News , then as a producer there , but he started to burn out after 10 years . After a run at the Barry Diller cable network Trio , he landed at Bravo , where he helped develop breakout successes like ? Top Chef ? and ? The Millionaire Matchmaker . ? Lauren Zalaznick , at the time president of Bravo , recalls someone coming in with hundreds of hours of documentary tape from a gated community in Orange County , Calif. which the producers needed to work . In that footage , Cohen saw something . ? I don ? t want to pretend like it was like lightning in a bottle at the beginning , ? he said . ? I was like : ? This is a soap opera . This is a soap opera . ? ? u2009 ? It was also something else . ? This is real life . ? ? Right before the first season aired in 2006 , he had a minor crisis over the opening credits . The ? Housewives ? shows usually begin with an introduction of each Housewife , posing in Grade A evening wear and announcing her tagline , which is part defensive apologia , part mission statement , part brand definition . But at the beginning , when they were editing the first season of Orange County , they went with sound bites from the show , like ? I don ? t wan na get old ? and ? percent of the women around here have had breast implants ? and ? Are the police involved ? ? When Cohen saw the first cut , he ran to the office of Shari Levine , Bravo ? s vice president of production , and told her she had to call the production company . The Housewives were going to think the producers were sabotaging them . But Levine told him the Housewives had already seen it ? and they loved it . Cohen learned that day that people stand behind their behavior , and that trying to protect them from themselves is a fundamental act of disrespect : ? These women , but maybe all women . I mean maybe all men , too I think all people want to be heard and understood . ? He learned too that people don ? t need you to fight their battles , that they are entitled to them , even if you think they ? re ridiculous . He learned that an audience will respond to however eccentric or stubborn or mean or dumb or kind a person is if that person is being authentic . ? The things that you think might embarrass them they actually feel like , Well , I was standing up for myself , ? he said . I eventually watched the episode of ? Real Housewives of Orange County ? that Kathleen French had warned Cohen about . It was part of a arc in which the women go to Ireland so that one of them , Meghan , can track down her ancestors . ( This is manifested as her actually tapping people on the shoulder in the street and asking if they are related to her . ) Now , ? Orange County , ? which is the screechiest ? Housewives ? franchise , had experienced so far a year of immense healing , with the Housewives working on forgiveness . That went right out the window on this trip . Kelly , whom I mentioned earlier , is someone prone to saying things like : ? What comes before Part B ? ! ? She also does the old ? What ? s on your shirt ? ? and when you look down , she flicks you in the nose . Well , it was one such flick , which she administered to Vicki , that plunged the whole trip into darkness . Kelly wanted to know why Heather was so uptight about it , since Jews are supposed to have a good sense of humor . Heather called Kelly racist , and Kelly , of course , said : ? I ? m not being racist . I ? m Mexican . ? Eventually , Tamra got involved , and Kelly said , ? No wonder why her daughter isn ? t talking to her , ? which prompted Tamra to lunge for Kelly and curse and hit her , and they were all kicked out of the department store they were in . Something Cohen knows , a belief that began to take root in him back when he was watching ? All My Children ? with his mother , was that people who interacted would always create something interesting . That ? s why he doesn ? t understand why anyone would think that ? Real Housewives ? wasn ? t real in some way . Or that it was too crass . Had people been on a subway recently ? Had they read an online comments section ? If anyone was under the impression that we were still in a Jane Austen novel in terms of national discourse and manners , it wasn ? t Cohen ? s fault that they were in for a rude awakening . It ? s all real . It wouldn ? t be compelling to watch if it weren ? t . Teresa Giudice was having a real breakdown when she flipped that table in New Jersey . But in New York , when Aviva Drescher got angry and threw her prosthetic leg at Le Cirque , of all places , in a effort to make her onscreen presence more interesting , well , that was the last we saw of Aviva . ? It is very real to them , ? he said . ? And by the way , when it ? s not , they ? re off the show . ? A few months after the women from Orange County returned from Ireland and watched the episodes through holes between their fingers , they pulled themselves together for the reunion . They put on clothing appropriate for Christmas dinner at the White House if it were Cinderella ? s gathered on two separate couches with Andy in the middle , folded their hands in their laps and apologized to one another . A few days after the election , Cohen began book promotion for ? Superficial . ? He started with a few local appearances , including one at the 92nd Street Y , where he was interviewed onstage by Sarah Jessica Parker . He had spent election night at her house , actually , and as soon as it became clear who the winner was , Cohen left the room to eat . A few days later , his optimism had mostly returned . Anderson Cooper told me when we met in St. Louis , ? I think Oprah said to Andy , ? You carry the light. ? When I heard that , I was like , That ? s really true . ? Onstage at the Y , he had already come around enough to say that he thinks that at heart , Donald Trump is a Democrat . The liberal , largely Jewish crowd , who had been reading about the terrifying increase of hate crimes since the election and had begun to feel as if the world were closing in faster than they ? d expected , responded with silence . We met at Cafe Cluny again a week later , and I asked him if he had noticed the silence . He said he didn ? t get it . He wanted to know why everyone he knew was so surprised about all of this . I ? d been watching the show , hadn ? t I ? I ? d seen Tamra from ? Orange County ? call Alexis ? Jesus Jugs , ? hadn ? t I ? How was that different from calling Hillary Clinton ? Crooked Hillary ? ? I ? d watched in the primaries as Trump defended the size of his penis , right ? ? Wouldn ? t that be the province of the Housewives if they were men ? ? He was right . Trump was not not like one of Cohen ? s Housewives . He knew he had to be entertaining to stay on the show . He was willing to say anything to get his contract extended . Throughout his campaign , he pulled out the ? I know something , but I ? m not going to say it now ? trick , most recently employed by Bethenny Frankel about dirt she has but won ? t reveal about both Dorinda and Jules at the last ? New York ? reunion . At the debates , the candidates fought for time to speak and demanded that they be allowed the time they were promised , which is what happens at the reunions . When Cohen saw that , he told me , he thought , Lester Holt , I feel your pain . Anderson Cooper was a moderator of a debate in St. Louis that ended with the candidates saying something nice about each other , which is exactly how Cohen ends some ? Real Housewives ? reunions . It was one thing when people were copying his format for a talk show and pretending it was theirs , but now life is copying his format , and he ? s still not quite getting credit for it ? just blame . But isn ? t that always the way for Cohen ? He ? s confronted from the audience , he ? s confronted by that guy in Washington , and still he ? s not getting the credit for what his gift actually is , which isn ? t knowing how to deviously propel national discourse into the gutter but instead delivering to viewers what they want before they know they want it . And still , they mess up the name of his show , calling it ? Watch What Happens Now . ? They accuse him of ruining America , when he carries the light . Even Oprah said it . Andy Cohen didn ? t invent our society . To think that is to have missed the entire point of him . He simply predicted it . He saw it coming before we did , and he taped it . He has a lack of judgment about the way the world works , and therefore doesn ? t have the willful ignorance that the rest of us do ? yes , we ? d seen Tamra call Alexis ? Jesus Jugs , ? and we insisted it was a tacky anomaly . But it wasn ? t . It was the way the world works now . Andy Cohen isn ? t how our culture got this way . He is simply a walking seismograph of it . Back at Cafe Cluny , I took one of the pieces of chocolate that came with the check he left the other two alone . I asked him what was going to happen next . He shrugged and opened his mouth to say something , pausing for what felt like a minute . Then he told me that it was all going to be O. K. and I decided to believe him .\n"

            "Document: After learning she had a high genetic risk for breast cancer , Dane ? e McCree , like a growing number of women , decided to have her breasts removed . Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with breasts . It did . But while Ms. McCree ? s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts , it is now completely numb . Her nipples lack any feeling . She can not sense the slightest touch of her breasts , perceive warmth or cold , feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door . And no one warned her . ? I can ? t even feel it when my kids hug me , ? said Ms. McCree , 31 , a store manager in Grand Junction , Colo. who is raising two daughters on her own . Plastic surgeons performed more than 106 , 000 breast reconstructions in 2015 , up 35 percent from 2000 . And they have embraced techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural ? look and feel ? ? using a woman ? s belly fat to create the new breast , sparing the nipple , minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger , firmer lifted breasts . Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before . But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms . Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear . The main problem is using the word ? feel , ? said Dr. Clara Lee , an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery . Surgeons who use a woman ? s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will ? feel ? like a natural breast , referring to how it feels to someone else , not the woman . ? We don ? t always mean what ? s important to the patient , ? Dr. Lee said . ? Our focus has been on what women look like , ? said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic , a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients ? quality of life after breast surgery . ? What it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery . That ? s the next frontier . ? The focus on how breasts look and feel to other people , rather than how they feel to the patient , speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance , said Victoria a professor and the head of feminist , gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University . ? There ? s such a strong cultural gaze at women ? s breasts , ? Dr. said . ? It does raise the question : Who is breast reconstruction for ? ? Adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations , particularly ? ? mastectomies . During a traditional mastectomy , doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue , causing considerable nerve damage . But now , in certain cases , the nipple can be spared , raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved . The actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her preventive double mastectomy in a New York Times in 2013 , inspiring other women at high risk of breast cancer to have their breasts removed . But the surgery has yet to fulfill its promise , and in most cases , sensation is not restored . For many women , the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating . ? No one said , ? You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again , ? ? Ms. McCree said . ? I thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply , I ? d keep my feeling . ? Eve Wallinga , 60 , a cancer survivor from St . Cloud , Minn. said many women who choose mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them ? whole ? again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back . ? They go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out ? they ? ll just have stuffing in their breasts , ? Ms. Wallinga said . ? Some are very angry and upset , and say , ? Why wasn ? t I told ? ? They feel very betrayed . ? The lack of sensation is potentially dangerous . Women who have had mastectomies and reconstruction surgery have sustained severe burns on their breasts from heating pads , hair dryers , curling irons , sunbathing and overly hot showers . Several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood . Many described embarrassing ? wardrobe malfunctions , ? when a bathing suit or shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin . A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later . Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts . ? It ? s not just about the sexual arousal , it ? s the awkwardness , ? said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights , N. J . ? You can ? t figure out your space ? almost like you ? re bigger than you really are . It ? s a bizarre feeling . ? She added , ? When I put on a sports bra , I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they ? re in the pocket where they belong . ? Nerve damage during mastectomies can create pain syndrome . Some women experience tingling sensations , and others have debilitating pain . Patients say physicians minimize the condition , even though it is fairly common , affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients , according to published studies . Michelle Lamon Romero , 45 , of East Longmeadow , Mass . said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago . She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level . ? The surface of the skin is numb ? if you run a needle over it , I can ? t feel it , ? Ms. Romero said . ? But I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere . ? She added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that ? this isn ? t real , it ? s all in your head . ? Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience . ? So many women who join are just relieved to know they ? re not alone , ? Ms. Romero said . ? They all start out the same way : ? My doctor told me I was crazy . ? ? Most surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman ? s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue . The procedure has produced modest results . If sensation returns , it is usually limited to the perception of pressure , without improved sensation related to touch , temperature or sexual arousal . ? It ? s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before , ? said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins , a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic . ? It ? s a poor substitute . ? Dr. Aldona J. Spiegel , a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation , said the procedure remained promising . ? I tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast , it will improve the sensation . But I never tell them it will be normal , ? Dr. Spiegel said . She added that many of her patients had shown ? very significant improvement . ? One of her patients , Karen Holt , 65 , a retired principal from Houston , had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago . Ms. Holt knows she ? s unusual , she said , but claims she has ? just about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right . ? But doctors say such results are rare . ? You don ? t want to give people false hope , ? said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce , a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans . Restoring sensation is ? one of those things that ? s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction , ? he said . ? But no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we ? re able to return sensation in any reliable way . ? Dr. Christine Laronga , a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa , Fla. said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction , telling them , ? It may look like a breast , but it won ? t feel like a breast . ? While doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves , they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone . There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome . ? It ? s a very tricky area , ? said Dr. Ida K. Fox , a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery . ? You don ? t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain . ? Ms. Balsamo , 50 , who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk , said she did not regret the surgery , but wished she had been better informed . ? I just wish I had known , ? Ms. Balsamo said . ? They said there ? s going to be a difference in the sensation ? not that there wouldn ? t be any . Before you go in , shouldn ? t you know the facts ? ?\n",
            "Document: Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if , along with the usual radiation , they also take drugs to block male hormones . The finding , published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine , comes from a study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients . After surgery to remove the prostate , more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence , and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them . Most are given radiation , but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent . The study , paid for by the National Cancer Institute , showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment , 76 . 3 percent were still alive after 12 years , compared to 71 . 3 percent who had radiation alone . At 12 years , the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer ? 5 . 8 percent versus 13 . 4 percent ? or to have the cancer spread around their bodies ? 14 . 5 percent versus 23 percent . ? This is a big deal , ? said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr. of the Christus Santa Rosa Health System in San Antonio , who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it . ? There are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we don ? t know if they make a big difference in survival . This is one of the things where now we can say for sure . ? He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice . The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration , and the treatments can cause hot flashes , sexual problems and other side effects . So to put a man through it , said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman , an author of the study , ? you ? d better have some decent justification . ? Dr. David F. Penson , the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said the study ? gives more credence to the concept that you have to treat the whole patient , ? rather than just irradiating the area where the cancer used to be . He said the idea of blocking hormones in men like those in the study was finding its way into medical practice . About 161 , 360 new cases of prostate cancer and 26 , 730 deaths are expected in the United States in 2017 , according to the American Cancer Society . The average age at diagnosis is 66 . Globally , there were 1 . 1 million cases and 307 , 000 deaths in 2012 , the most recent data available from the World Health Organization . The study , begun in 1998 and led by Dr. William U. Shipley , a radiation oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital , had an ambitious goal : to follow the patients long enough to find out whether treatment would affect their survival . Prostate cancer grows slowly , so it took well over a decade for answers to emerge . Researchers and patients from 150 sites in North America participated . The patients were 760 men who had their prostates removed for cancer that had not spread , but who then had a sign of recurrence ? a rise in their blood levels of antigen , or PSA , a protein associated with prostate cancer . The men in the study had PSAs of 0 . 2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter . ? That ? s just like the first wisp of smoke , ? said Dr. Zietman , who is a professor of radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School . ? There ? ll be fire someday . ? The fire might take five , 10 or 15 years to break out , but Dr. Zietman said , ? Many are in their 50s or 60s , and will live long enough to get into trouble . ? The traditional practice for a rising PSA after surgery has been to give radiation , which targets only the pelvis . The idea of the study was to add hormonal treatment , which might stop minute clumps of cancer that had spread to other parts of the body . All the men in the study had radiation for six and a half weeks . For two years , half also received a drug , bicalutamide , and the other half were given placebos . They were followed , on average , for about 13 years . ? This is the first trial that ? s shown , if you follow these patients long enough , there is a real difference , ? Dr. Zietman said . ? More people survive 15 years later . ? Men who had more aggressive cancers ? reflected by higher PSA readings after surgery and by the pathology and surgical reports on their tumors ? had the most to gain from the treatment . The results do not mean that every man with a rising PSA after surgery should have hormone treatment , Dr. Zietman said . Men 75 or older may not need it , because they may die from other causes before the cancer can catch up with them . ? But if they ? re younger and with a longer life expectancy , treatment is reasonable , ? he said . Bicalutamide causes men to develop breasts and potentially other problems , and the high dose given in the study is no longer used in the United States . Other drugs like Lupron have mostly taken its place , and may be even more effective , Dr. Zietman said . The study proved the concept that hormone blocking increases survival , he added , so other drugs that do the same thing should also help patients live longer . Another study in progress in Canada and Europe uses the newer drugs , and is trying to determine whether taking them for six months , rather than two years , might be enough .\n",
            "Document: BARCELONA , Spain ? President Trump ? s travel ban disrupted the plans of hundreds of people around the globe , but perhaps none more vulnerable than Sham Aldaher , a Syrian refugee girl , and her family . Sham , now 1Â® , was born without an eye and with a seriously disfigured face . Following two complex operations at a Barcelona hospital , Sham is due to receive an eye prosthesis next Wednesday . Her family had then planned to resettle in the United States . They had already completed the required interviews and cleared all security checks before the plans were blocked by Mr. Trump ? s executive order to bar citizens from Syria and six other countries seen as threatening to America ? s safety . ? They were and they are now barred , ? said Jayne Fleming , the head of the human rights team at Reed Smith , an American law firm that has been helping Sham and her family . Ms. Fleming and her team are now scrambling to see whether Britain , Germany or another country could instead welcome the family . ? They ? re distressed over not knowing what the future holds for them . ? The Aldahers ? story is a nomadic tragedy , telling of the accumulated hardships that have been piled on many Syrian refugees . It is also a small but striking example of the broader crisis highlighted in a United Nations report issued on Tuesday showing that the children most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by Mr. Trump ? s order . Sham ? s parents left Syria and their jobs as teachers in 2013 . They traveled with their three children to Lebanon and then Egypt . But their arrival coincided with the unrest and military coup that removed Mohamed Morsi as Egypt ? s president . ? We left our home to find safety , but in Egypt there were bombings in the night and the children were very afraid , ? said Ali Aldaher , Sham ? s father . So the family packed up again to join thousands of other Syrian refugees in Jordan . Sham was born there in July 2015 , on the day of the Muslim holiday of Eid . The coincidence was seen as a blessing by her parents , but it complicated Sham ? s birth , as most local hospital workers were on vacation and the family could not find a doctor . Even though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth , Sham ? s mother ? did not receive the health care she needed and I ? m sure all the stress hurt , ? Mr. Aldaher recounted . When Sham was born , her father tried to calm his wife by pretending Sham was keeping one eye shut , even though he could see that she had no eyelid and a misshaped face . ? Before the birth of Sham , my worries were how would I support my family , without any work in Jordan and without money , ? Mr. Aldaher said . ? After she was born , we forgot about food , our problems , ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for Sham , to see how we could possibly care for this child . ? Sham ? s family received assistance from different nongovernmental organizations , including Doctors Without Borders . Lawyers from Reed Smith started searching for a hospital capable of undertaking such advanced surgery , while helping the family apply for resettlement in the United States . The lawyers then delayed the move to America because they could not simultaneously find an American hospital ready to treat Sham at no cost . Instead , the Sant Joan de D ? u hospital in Barcelona agreed to help . Entering Spain , however , also proved a struggle . In June 2016 , the Spanish government granted Sham ? s family permission to travel to Barcelona , shortly after The New York Times published an article about the infant ? s plight and Spain ? s refusal to grant visas to the whole family . Even before Mr. Trump ? s executive order to bar citizens of some countries from entering the United States , on security grounds , many European governments were dragging their feet in meeting their own commitments to welcome more refugees , following a European Union agreement reached in September 2015 . By the end of 2016 , about 900 refugees had resettled in Spain , out of the quota of 17 , 377 agreed on by Spain ? s government . Sham underwent two major facial surgeries in Barcelona . In August , doctors reset her facial bones , also to make room for an eye orbit . In December , they fissured her skin into an eyelid and implanted fat taken from Sham ? s bottom into the artificial orbit , which was then with a curved plastic shell . Sham is due to receive her eye prosthesis next Wednesday . Dr. Joan Prat , the chief ophthalmologist at the Sant Joan de D ? u hospital , said he used a unique technique to ? invent a cavity from zero . ? The eye surgery was not only difficult but also urgent , because Sham ? s face will soon reach a level of development that would make the disfigurement permanent . ? Either we did something now or it was game over , ? Dr. Prat said . The kind of disorder suffered by Sham , known as anophthalmia , occurs ? only every few years , ? he added . The surgery was a success , but Dr. Prat said Sham should remain under close monitoring , not only because of her face but also because of other health concerns , including her failure to put on weight . Further surgery will be required to correct facial asymmetries as she grows , while her eye prothesis will also need replacement . Sham and her family were granted residency in Spain until late December . They have been housed in a apartment , a stone ? s throw from the Sagrada FamÂ­lia , Barcelona ? s emblematic basilica . Ms. Fleming said that the family wanted to live in the United States in large part because Sham could get excellent medical care there . She acknowledged that the family was now concerned about a backlash against Muslims in America and that ? they are distressed by rhetoric that brands them as terrorists . ? In Barcelona , Sham ? s family has received support from the city , as well as Caritas and other nongovernmental organizations . Sham ? s siblings have joined a local school . On a bookshelf , the family keeps a small Quran that is among the few items that traveled with them from Syria . A prayer mat is also pinned to the wall , but the family normally goes to a Barcelona mosque for Friday Prayer . When the girl was born , her mother gave her an ancient name for Syria , Sham . Wherever the family finally ends up living , she said , ? one day Sham will ask me what is the meaning of her name and I will at least be able to tell her that it is your country , it is Syria . ?\n",
            "Document: During her pregnancy , she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette . But nearly every day , Stacey , then 24 , smoked marijuana . With her fianc ? ? s blessing , she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop . When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her shifts , she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break . ? I wouldn ? t necessarily say , ? Go smoke a pound of pot when you ? re pregnant , ? ? said Stacey , now a mother in Deltona , Fla. who asked that her full name be withheld because marijuana is illegal in Florida . ? In moderation , it ? s O. K. ? Many pregnant women , particularly younger ones , seem to agree , a recent federal survey shows . As states legalize marijuana or its medical use , expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers ? another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health . Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants . But preliminary research suggests otherwise : Marijuana ? s main psychoactive ingredient ? tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC ? can cross the placenta to reach the fetus , experts say , potentially harming brain development , cognition and birth weight . THC can also be present in breast milk . ? There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use , even in pregnancy , without data to say it ? s actually safe , ? said Dr. Torri Metz , an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in pregnancies . Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use . In the federal survey , published online in December , almost 4 percent of said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014 , compared with 2 . 4 percent in 2002 . ( By comparison , roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month . ) Young were particularly likely to turn to marijuana : Roughly 7 . 5 percent of to said they had used pot in the past month in 2014 , compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44 . Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory . Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers , in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa , who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb . In Pittsburgh , born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading . At age 10 , children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention . Most troubling , children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading , math and spelling at age 14 than their peers . ? Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly , ? said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson , the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses , 18 to 22 weeks old , linked to maternal marijuana use . In male fetuses who were exposed , for instance , researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala , the part of the brain that regulates emotion . ? Even early in development , marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors , ? said Dr. Yasmin Hurd , a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan . ? Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward , even motor function and cognition . ? It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use , even eventually reducing I. Q . ? The effects are not dramatic , but that doesn ? t mean they are not important , ? said Jodi Gilman , an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis . ? It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B. ? ? You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana , ? she added . The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement . But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic . Of five federal agencies , only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February , according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse . Only 10 state health departments did . Until recently , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing . ? I don ? t think public health officials should be alarming people , ? said Marian Jarlenski , the study ? s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health . ? They just have to say , ? There have been studies done , and there is some risk . ? ? In a statement , C. D. C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero . ? While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent , some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy , such as low birth weight or preterm birth , ? the agency said . Dr. Marie McCormick , a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine , said smoking cannabis ? does confer , in terms of birth weight , the same risk as cigarettes . ? Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring . So far , prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects . ? That ? s why some providers and lay people alike think there ? s no effect , ? said Dr. Erica Wymore , a neonatologist at Children ? s Hospital Colorado . But she warned , ? Just because they don ? t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn ? t mean the baby ? s neurological development is not impacted . ? Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent . Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014 , while in 1995 it was just 4 percent , according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . ? All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren ? t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels , ? said Therese Grant , an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington ? s fetal alcohol and drug unit . ? We need to do a whole lot more research now . ? There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use . Research is often based on reports by pregnant women ? instead of , say , tests of urine or the umbilical cord ? and they consistently underreport their use . ( Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies . ) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself . Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother ? s body for weeks , if not months . It ? s not known whether the fetus ? s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit . To find out whether that ? s happening , Dr. Judy Chang , an at the University of Pittsburgh , and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients . Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana , the researchers found , than to advise them of potential risks . When admitted to marijuana use , almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all . Pregnant women aren ? t eager to discuss it , either , because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture . Depression , anxiety , stress , pain , nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado . Roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant . ? Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition , ? said Elizabeth Nash , a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy . ? If you ? re going to consider it like medicine , ? she said , ? then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it . ? Stacey ? s son just had his first birthday . He ? s walking , talking and and she isn ? t worried about his development . She still smokes pot ? indeed , her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf . But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now . ? I don ? t have to smoke as much anymore , ? she said .\n",
            "Document: Kiah Stokes celebrated New Year ? s Eve at a nightclub in Istanbul , where she plays basketball for Besiktas of the Turkish league . But a night of revelry turned alarming when club employees told patrons they had to shut down early for security reasons . As Stokes and her friends left the building , they saw roads . They cautiously walked for about 10 minutes before finding a taxi to take them home , not knowing that a gunman had killed 39 people at another club down the street and was still at large . ? You don ? t think something can happen , ? said Stokes , who , in September , finished her second season with the Liberty of the W. N. B . A . ? Now I ? m like , ? Wow , this is just scary . ? ? Players like Stokes have long packed up after the W. N. B . A. season and spent their winters abroad , competing with teams that offer larger paychecks than the women can earn in the American league . This more W. N. B . A. players ended up in Turkey than in any other country . There are now 26 , according to the league ? s players ? association . The unrest there ? an attempted coup last summer and multiple terrorist attacks ? has led some players to question the costs of taking a second job overseas . It has also added urgency to efforts to keep W. N. B . A. players in the United States in the . ? It ? s kind of sad we can ? t stay home , ? said Liberty guard Sugar Rodgers , who played for the Turkish club Osmaniye but returned to Virginia in November because she did not feel safe . About two weeks after the Liberty were eliminated from the playoffs , Rodgers joined Osmaniye , which is based about two hours from the Syrian border . Shortly after her arrival , a car bombing killed at least 17 people at a checkpoint in Syria ? s Aleppo Province . ? That right there shook me , ? said Rodgers , who has also played in France , Israel and Slovakia . She acknowledged that the United States was not immune to such violence , but in Turkey , the threat of danger felt almost constant . ? Getting emails saying families from embassies are leaving ? the consulate or embassy were leaving ? that rings a bell , ? Rodgers said . She soon got out of her contract . ? My team was understanding , ? Rodgers said , adding , ? I ? m not going to play to my full potential always watching over my back . ? As Turkey became increasingly unstable last year , the W. N. B . A. and the players ? association arranged new security measures for the women who would go overseas in the . In late December , the league provided an app that would allow players to communicate easily with the W. N. B . A. office from anywhere in the world . In an emergency , the office can give information about safe areas and contacts . Jayne ? the union ? s associate director of player relations , who competed in China and Turkey as well as in the W. N. B . A. ? set up and maintained a group chat for the league ? s players in Turkey . When Terri Carmichael Jackson , a former N. C. A . A. executive , became the director of operations for the players ? association last May , she focused on improving security for players overseas . The union met with the league ? s director of security , Eric Rhodes , who suggested more collaboration with the State Department and some relatively simple measures , like pointing players to the department ? s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program . The program , a State Department spokesman said , allows travelers to ? receive messages from the nearest U. S. Embassy or Consulate , which stand at the ready to assist U. S. citizens abroad . ? ? We get news of an incident , ? Jackson said , ? and we kind of have a plan in place , informally , here in the office . ? She added , ? There ? s always a concern there might be a blackout with media and news services . ? Lisa M. Borders , the W. N. B . A. ? s president , was attending church services when she heard about the Istanbul attack . Last season , her first as president , Borders gave her personal cellphone number to every player in the league . Until New Year ? s Eve , it was seen primarily as a gesture of good will . Borders said that after contacting the league ? s security officials that night for instructions , she reached out to players individually . She declined to name which players had communicated with her . ? I feel compelled to be deeply engaged with my players overseas , as well as domestically , ? she said . ? Speaking to players immediately in harm ? s way is very relieving to me ? that I can reach them with a phone call , that they will answer me or FaceTime me and let me know what ? s happening . ? Players have noticed the league ? s increased efforts to ensure their safety abroad . But many pointed out that they would not feel the need to leave the United States if their W. N. B . A. salaries were higher . According to the most recent agreement , players in the W. N. B . A. received a base salary of $ 39 , 676 to $ 50 , 617 in 2016 , not including performance bonuses , housing stipends and other benefits . A player in her third year made as much as $ 54 , 609 . The most recent agreement also included a $ 50 , 000 bonus for each team to distribute among players who limit their overseas competition to three months or less . Aside from relieving security fears , an athlete who stays in the United States avoids the physical stress of an extra basketball season . The league also offers professional internships and programs for the and it is considering other ways to keep players home in the winter . ? I get it , ? Borders said . ? You want to make sure you are having one job making enough money to pay bills , sustain family and do things we all want to do . That day will come . ? The league needs more revenue for that to happen , she said , adding that her chief operating officer , Jay Parry , met early this month with executives from each team to explore ways to increase attendance . Stokes , who did not disclose her Besiktas salary , said she would probably forgo her second job if the W. N. B . A. could replace most of her overseas income . An ESPN article in 2012 quoted an agent ? s estimate that the average overseas salary for a female basketball player was $ 72 , 000 . For now , Stokes plans to remain in Turkey until the season ends in early May , despite the hazards . A few weeks before the New Year ? s Eve attack , dozens of people were killed in a double bombing outside Besiktas ? s soccer stadium , about a mile from where Stokes lives . ? It freaked me out , ? she said . She had read about the country ? s turmoil during the summer , but she took comfort in knowing that a Liberty teammate who had played in Turkey before , Shavonte Zellous , would also be on the Besiktas team . But Zellous said her past experience in the country did not match what she was seeing this season . ? The cities they ? re bombing , I never imagined terror groups doing something in these cities , ? Zellous said . ? I think stuff is really getting real now . ? Stokes said that security measures had become noticeably stronger at games and that the team had more frequent police escorts on the road . She also said that she had become attached to her Turkish team and felt a certain level of commitment to it , even if friends and family yearn for her to return . ? My mom wants me to come home right now , ? Stokes said . ? She said it ? s too dangerous , it ? s scary . She knows the money is good , but it ? s not worth it . It definitely crossed my mind . ?\n"

A special prosecutor investigating the corruption scandal that led to President Park  ?s impeachment summoned the de facto head of Samsung for questioning on Wednesday, calling him a bribery suspect. The de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung, will be questioned on Thursday, according to the special prosecutor?s office, which recommended that he also be investigated on suspicion of perjury. Mr. Lee effectively runs Samsung, South Korea?s largest conglomerate he is the son of its chairman, Lee   who has been incapacitated with health problems. He is expected to be asked whether   donations that Samsung made to two foundations controlled by Choi   a longtime friend of the president, amounted to bribes, and what role, if any, he played in the decision to give the money. Investigators at the special prosecutor?s office have questioned other senior Samsung executives as suspects about the bribery accusations. Neither Samsung nor Mr. Lee responded immediately to the announcement on Wednesday. Allegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the National Assembly?s vote to impeach her last month. Since then, Ms. Park?s powers have been suspended, and she is on trial at the Constitutional Court, which will ultimately decide whether to end her presidency. Last month, Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the donations. He also said that the donations were not voluntary, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery. The reference on Wednesday to possible perjury charges against Mr. Lee stemmed from that testimony. The special prosecutor?s office said it had evidence that Mr. Lee had ?received a request for bribery from the president and ordered Samsung subsidiaries to send bribes to destinations designated by the president. ? It asked the National Assembly to file a perjury complaint against Mr. Lee, which would authorize the special prosecutor to open an investigation of that charge. Asked whether investigators would seek to arrest Mr. Lee on bribery charges, a spokesman for the special prosecutor?s office, Lee   said, ?All possibilities are open. ? In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on charges of coercing 53 big businesses, including Samsung, to contribute $69 million to her two foundations. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice but stopped short of filing any charges against the businesses, all of which insisted that they were under government pressure to donate. In its impeachment bill, the National Assembly asserted that the donations were bribes, made with the expectation of political favors from the president. The special prosecutor, which took over the investigations from the state prosecutors last month, has been looking into possible bribery charges against not only Ms. Park but the businesses, particularly Samsung. Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office. Samsung gave the largest donations to Ms. Choi?s foundations, totaling $17 million. Unlike the other corporate contributors, it went beyond support for the foundations, signing an $18 million contract with a sports management company that Ms. Choi ran in Germany, to fund a program for training Korean equestrians, which mainly benefited Ms. Choi?s daughter. Samsung also contributed $1. 3 million to a winter sports program for young athletes that Ms. Choi and her nephew ran. Also on Wednesday, the special prosecutor?s office said it had acquired a tablet computer used by Ms. Choi that contained emails she exchanged with a Samsung executive. The emails contained information about the financial support provided by Samsung, the prosecutor?s office said. The special prosecutor has been investigating whether Samsung gave its support to Ms. Choi in exchange for a decision by the   National Pension Service to support a contentious merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. Moon   chairman of the pension fund, was arrested last month on charges that he illegally pressured the fund to back that merger when he was South Korea?s health and welfare minister. The national pension fund?s support was crucial for the merger, which analysts said helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A special prosecutor investigating the corruption scandal that led to President Park  ?s impeachment summoned the de facto head of Samsung for questioning on Wednesday, calling him a bribery suspect. The de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung, will be questioned on Thursday, according to the special prosecutor?s office, which recommended that he also be investigated on suspicion of perjury. Mr. Lee effectively runs Samsung, South Korea?s largest conglomerate he is the son of its chairman, Lee   who has been incapacitated with health problems. He is expected to be asked whether   donations that Samsung made to two foundations controlled by Choi   a longtime friend of the president, amounted to bribes, and what role, if any, he played in the decision to give the money. Investigators at the special prosecutor?s office have questioned other senior Samsung executives as suspects about the bribery accusations. Neither Samsung nor Mr. Lee responded immediately to the announcement on Wednesday. Allegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the National Assembly?s vote to impeach her last month. Since then, Ms. Park?s powers have been suspended, and she is on trial at the Constitutional Court, which will ultimately decide whether to end her presidency. Last month, Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the donations. He also said that the donations were not voluntary, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery. The reference on Wednesday to possible perjury charges against Mr. Lee stemmed from that testimony. The special prosecutor?s office said it had evidence that Mr. Lee had ?received a request for bribery from the president and ordered Samsung subsidiaries to send bribes to destinations designated by the president. ? It asked the National Assembly to file a perjury complaint against Mr. Lee, which would authorize the special prosecutor to open an investigation of that charge. Asked whether investigators would seek to arrest Mr. Lee on bribery charges, a spokesman for the special prosecutor?s office, Lee   said, ?All possibilities are open. ? In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on charges of coercing 53 big businesses, including Samsung, to contribute $69 million to her two foundations. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice but stopped short of filing any charges against the businesses, all of which insisted that they were under government pressure to donate. In its impeachment bill, the National Assembly asserted that the donations were bribes, made with the expectation of political favors from the president. The special prosecutor, which took over the investigations from the state prosecutors last month, has been looking into possible bribery charges against not only Ms. Park but the businesses, particularly Samsung. Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office. Samsung gave the largest donations to Ms. Choi?s foundations, totaling $17 million. Unlike the other corporate contributors, it went beyond support for the foundations, signing an $18 million contract with a sports management company that Ms. Choi ran in Germany, to fund a program for training Korean equestrians, which mainly benefited Ms. Choi?s daughter. Samsung also contributed $1. 3 million to a winter sports program for young athletes that Ms. Choi and her nephew ran. Also on Wednesday, the special prosecutor?s office said it had acquired a tablet computer used by Ms. Choi that contained emails she exchanged with a Samsung executive. The emails contained information about the financial support provided by Samsung, the prosecutor?s office said. The special prosecutor has been investigating whether Samsung gave its support to Ms. Choi in exchange for a decision by the   National Pension Service to support a contentious merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. Moon   chairman of the pension fund, was arrested last month on charges that he illegally pressured the fund to back that merger when he was South Korea?s health and welfare minister. The national pension fund?s support was crucial for the merger, which analysts said helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"split_sentence_spacy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
